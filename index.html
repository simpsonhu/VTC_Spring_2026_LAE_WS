					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p> The perpetual exacerbation of traditional terrestrial network resource congestion and the exponential proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) service demands are propelling the investigation of integrated low-altitude economy (LAE) network systems. Contemporary traditional wireless networks confront three fundamental constraints: the inherent bandwidth limitations of conventional network architectures, the computational capacity ceiling of edge devices, and the latency bottlenecks in backhaul transmission links. Consequently, the critical functionalities of mobile sensing, data communication, and distributed computation within existing wireless systems have traditionally been developed in a modular manner. This architectural paradigm presents persistent challenges in achieving holistic optimisation of end-to-end latency minimisation and energy efficiency enhancement across the complete wireless system spectrum. Diverging from conventional terrestrial network capacity enhancement approaches, LAE networks integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have emerged as an efficient solution to improve the performance of networks. Specifically, in the realms of AI-empowered LAE networks, AI technologies augment the cognitive, learning, and decision-making functionalities of LAE networks, which facilitates the optimisation of resource utilisation and the improvement of network performance. Thus, research on AI-empowered integrated sensing and communication/computation (ISAC) LAE networks proposes innovative decentralised architectures capable of simultaneously satisfying the heterogeneous quality-of-service requirements, including ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC), ultra-massive machine-type connectivity (umMTC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), demanded by next-generation IoT applications. This systematic analysis elucidates the theoretical foundations, contemporary technological developments, and prospective research trajectories in AI-empowered ISAC LAE networks while establishing an integrative framework for understanding their multidimensional interactions and cross-industry transformative potential.</p> 
				                <p> We are seeking original, completed, and unpublished works that are not under review elsewhere, aiming to assemble a collection of high-quality, crosscutting research papers on a variety of topics, which include, but are not limited to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>AI-empowered integrated communication, sensing, and computing for LAE transport networks</li>
							<li>AI-empowered resource management and optimisation for LAE communication networks</li>
							<li>AI-empowered wireless charging system design and optimisation for LAE application</li>
							<li>AI-empowered testbed and real-world evaluation of LAE systems</li>
							<li>AI-empowered model design, deployment, and assessment for digital twin-enabled LAE applications</li>
							<li>AI-empowered UAV detection, positioning, and navigation optimisation for LAE applications</li>
							<li>AI-empowered swarm technology for LAE application scenarios</li>
							<li>AI-empowered security and privacy model design in LAE scenarios</li>
